## Car Protection system
This project is comes into picture to reduce the accidents throgh the vehicles on highways or the roads.
Automotive safety is the and practice of design, construction, equipment and regulation to minimize the occurrence and consequences of traffic collisions involving motor vehicles. Road traffic safety more broadly includes roadway design.

The rising trend of autonomous things is largely driven by the move towards the autonomous car, that both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. The autonomous car is expected to be safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element - the driver. The Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School claims that "Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error". But while safety standards like the ISO 26262 specify the required safety, it is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety.
## Working
This system works on very basic rule. This system detects the obstacle with the help of ultrasonic sensor. Then this is analog in nature and must be converted into digital signal. Then this signal is passed through ADC then this signal is send to the PWM and with the the help of DC motor it gets slows down and and the driver can succesfully save himself and other from accident.
